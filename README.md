# solcpp

This is a simple collection of examples and dependencies to use Solana from c++.
By no means a complete SDK, yet, rather a starting point for the community to
form around and take it to the next level. If you are experienced in c++ dev and
want to work on this full-time, contact @m_schneider on twitter.

# Dependencies

These are the dependencies I installed on my development machine, using
homebrew, other versions might work. Please report if you get it to run on
earlier versions. The CI runs the tests using a container built with the
`Dockerfile` that packages all dependencies.

- C++17
- boost 1.76.0 [Boost]
- cpr 1.7.2 [MIT]
- curl 7.81.0 [MIT]
- doctest 2.4.8 [MIT]
- sodium 1.0.18 [ISC]
- websocketpp 0.8.2 [BSD]
- nlohmann-json 3.10.5 [MIT]

In addition some dependencies were directly included and slighly modified to
work well with the rest of the code base.

# Examples

- Load & decode AccountInfo
- Subscribe to account updates (fills)
- Send Transaction
- Build complex transactions (atomic cancel and replace)

# TODO

1. Find a maintainer
2. Make a proper SDK out of this mess, this includes solving engineering issues,
   I have no idea about, like:

- proper dependency installation
- API design
- proper packaging so it can be installed

3. Improve liquidity on mango markets
