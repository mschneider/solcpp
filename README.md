# solcpp

A collection of examples and dependencies to use Solana from C++. By no
means a complete SDK, yet, rather a starting point for the community to form
around and take it to the next level. If you are experienced in c++ dev and want
to work on this full-time, contact @m_schneider on twitter.

# Dependencies

The project uses [conan.io](https://conan.io/) to manage the following
dependencies. Install Conan [here](https://conan.io/downloads.html).

- C++17
- boost 1.76.0 [Boost]
- cpr 1.7.2 [MIT]
- curl 7.81.0 [MIT]
- doctest 2.4.8 [MIT]
- sodium 1.0.18 [ISC]
- websocketpp 0.8.2 [BSD]
- nlohmann-json 3.10.5 [MIT]

## Usage
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "solana.h"

// Example: getAccountInfo RPC method

const auto rpc_url = "...";
const auto pubKey = "..";
sol::Connection connection = sol::Connection{rpc_url, "finalized"};
auto key  = sol::PublicKey::fromBase58(pubKey);
std::optional<sol::AccountInfo> info = connection.getAccountInfo(key);
if (!info.has_value()){
    std::cout << "Account doesn't exist.\n";
    return;
}
std::cout << "Account Owner: " << info.value().owner.toBase58() << std::endl;


```

## Building:

```sh
# Create a default profile or copy over the example for linux / macos
$ conan profile new default --detect
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ conan install ..  \
  --build=missing \
  -o:h boost:without_fiber=True \ # Skips building boost's header-only fiber
  -o:h boost:without_python=True \ # Skips python bindings
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build .
$ ./bin/tests
```

_Note: if you have issues building libcurl on gcc-9, try clang. See
[issue](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/4821)._

_Note: if you have issues linking cpr on linux gcc, try compiling with
`libcxx=libstdc++11`. See [issue](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr/issues/125)._

In addition some dependencies were directly included and slighly modified to
work well with the rest of the code base.

# Examples

- Load & decode AccountInfo
- Subscribe to account updates (fills)
- Send Transaction
- Build complex transactions (atomic cancel and replace)

## TODO

- [ ] Find a maintainer
- [ ] Make a proper SDK out of this mess, this includes solving engineering
      issues, I have no idea about, like:

- API design
- packaging so it can be easily installed

- [ ] Improve liquidity on mango markets
- [ ] Remove/replace deprecated methods
- [ ] Remove the pragma warnings
- [ ] Implement all the HTTP RPC calls in `connection.h`
- [ ] Add support for websocket to `Connection` instance.
- [ ] Support templated `AccountInfo<T>`
- [ ] Support multiple concurrent connection instances.
- [ ] Add more test coverage.
- [ ] Develop a Getting started guide/wiki.
